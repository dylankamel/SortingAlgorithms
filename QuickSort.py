# suppose we have a list of numbers [5,10,2,1,3,4,20,15]
# we will have a pivot number (first last,mid, or random number)
# for this lets say our pivot number is 15 (last number)
# we will put this number in the correct position

# so it will be sorted as:
# 5,10,2,1,3,4,    15,    20
#   list 1                 list 2 and 15 will be at position 6

# now get a new pivot number this one will be 4

# 2,1,3,    4, 5,10           20

#repeat this until there are all empty list or 1 number

# sorted array [][][][4][][][15][20]
